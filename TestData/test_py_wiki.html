<p><b>Python</b> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
    readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to
    help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.</p>
<p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
    (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
    included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
<p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first
    released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list
    comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in
    2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was
    discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.</p>
<p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) in the
    Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception
    handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating
    system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the
    lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's
    "benevolent dictator for life", a title
    the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In
    January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.</p>
<p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008,
    with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the
    <code>2to3</code> utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
<p>Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of
    existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will
    be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported.
</p>
<p>Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to
    possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.</p>

<h2>Design philosophy and features</h2>
<p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully
    supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by
    metaprogramming and metaobjects [magic methods] ). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including
    design by contract and logic programming.</p>
<p>Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for
    memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during
    program execution.
</p>
<p>Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has
    <code>filter</code>,<code>map</code>and<code>reduce</code> functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and
    generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (<code>itertools</code> and <code>functools</code>) that
    implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.</p>
<p>Its core philosophy is summarized in the document <i>The Zen of Python</i> (<i>PEP 20</i>), which includes aphorisms
    such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
    <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
    <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
    <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
    <li>Readability counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules.
    This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing
    applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible
    interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.</p>
<p>Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding
    methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be
    one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it" philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software
    Foundation and Python book author, wrote: "To describe something as 'clever' is <i>not</i> considered a compliment
    in the Python culture."</p>
<p>Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython
    reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is
    important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C;
    or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes
    direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.
</p>
<p>Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group
    Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that
    refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.</p>
<p>A common neologism in the Python community is <i>pythonic</i>, which has a wide range of meanings related to program
    style. "Pythonic" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with
    Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a
    rough transcription from another programming language is called <i>unpythonic</i>.</p>
<p>Python users and admirers, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as
    <i>Pythonistas</i>.</p>

<h2>Syntax and semantics</h2>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096">
<p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and often uses English
    keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to
    delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and
    special cases than C or Pascal.</p>

<h3>Indentation</h3>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096">
<p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in
    indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus,
    the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the
    off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The
    recommended indent size is four spaces.</p>

<h3>Statements and control flow</h3>
<p>Python's statements include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The assignment statement, using a single equals sign <code>=</code></li>
    <li>The <code>if</code> statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with <code>else</code> and
        <code>elif</code> (a contraction of else-if)</li>
    <li>The <code>for</code> statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local
        variable for use by the attached block</li>
    <li>The <code>while</code> statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true</li>
    <li>The <code>try</code> statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and
        handled by <code>except</code> clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a <code>finally</code> block is
        always run regardless of how the block exits</li>
    <li>The <code>raise</code> statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception</li>
    <li>The <code>class</code> statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class,
        for use in object-oriented programming</li>
    <li>The <code>def</code> statement, which defines a function or method</li>
    <li>The <code>with</code> statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a
        lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file), allowing
        resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom</li>
    <li>The <code>break</code> statement, which exits a loop</li>
    <li>The <code>continue</code> statement, which skips the current iteration and continues with the next</li>
    <li>The <code>del</code> statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and
        producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined</li>
    <li>The <code>pass</code> statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block</li>
    <li>The <code>assert</code> statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply</li>
    <li>The <code>yield</code> statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used
        to implement coroutines</li>
    <li>The <code>return</code> statement, used to return a value from a function</li>
    <li>The <code>import</code> statement, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the
        current program</li>
</ul>
<p>The assignment statement (<code>=</code>) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object.
    Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference
    holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to <i>some</i> object with a type. This is called
    dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain
    type.
</p>
<p>Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to van Rossum, it never
    will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators. Before
    2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it
    is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple
    stack levels.</p>

<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>Some Python expressions are similar to those in languages such as C and Java, while some are not:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Addition, subtraction and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types
        of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) <code>//</code> and
        floating-point<code>/</code>division. Python also uses the <code>**</code> operator for exponentiation.</li>
    <li>The <code>@</code> infix operator was introduced in Python 3.5. It is intended to be used by libraries such as
        NumPy for matrix multiplication.</li>
    <li>The syntax <code>:=</code>, called the "walrus operator", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to
        variables as part of a larger expression.</li>
    <li>In Python, <code>==</code> compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by
        reference. Python's <code>is</code> operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference),
        and comparisons may be chained—for example, <code class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-python mw-content-ltr"
            id="" style=""
            dir="ltr"><span>a</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>b</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>c</span></code>.</li>
    <li>Python uses <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> as boolean operators rather than the
        symbolic <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code> in Java and C.</li>
    <li>Python has a type of expression called a <i>list comprehension</i>, as well as a more general expression called
        a <i>generator expression</i>.</li>
    <li>Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each
        body.</li>
    <li>Conditional expressions are written as <code class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-python mw-content-ltr" id=""
            style="" dir="ltr"><span>x</span> <span>if</span> <span>c</span> <span>else</span> <span>y</span></code>
        (different in order of operands from the <code>c ? x : y</code> operator common to many other languages).</li>
    <li>Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as <code
            class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-python mw-content-ltr" id="" st
